<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Matthew Backos, and I was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa.
I am an aspiring web developer and software engineer with a diverse background, having worked as an assistant adventure guide and a professional chef.</p>

<p>I have always been driven by curiosity and a passion for learning, regardless of the nature of the work or the project at hand.
This curiosity has led me to develop a deep interest in IT concepts and a love for problem-solving.
My goal is to leverage software development to improve my life and the lives of those around me.</p>

<p>I am committed to continuously honing my existing skills while eagerly acquiring new ones that best suit the projects I undertake.
I am goal-driven, objective-oriented, and thrive under deadlines.
I am excited about contributing to projects and, most importantly, collaborating effectively within a team to achieve success.</p>
