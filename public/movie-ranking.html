<h3>Interstellar - Christpher Nolan</h3>
    <h4>2014</h4>
<p>I can safely say this movie will always rank quite high for me.
I've always been a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this film ignited a lifelong admiration for cinema.</p>

<h3>No country for old men - Joel & Ethan Coen </h3>
<h4>2007</h4>
<p>One of the highlights i can mention from this film is how unsettling it can be at times.
It strikes a calculated balance between suspense and action. Combined with the magnificent cast and script it is one for the ages.

<h3>Babylon - Damien Chazelle</h3>
    <h4>2022</h4>
<p>I think this film was seriously ambitious. Every shot, line of dialogue and decison made while 
putting this film together was expertly crafted and that sense of care was evident to me. It is a generational 
masterpiece and all-in-all a benchamrk for beautiful film for years to come.
